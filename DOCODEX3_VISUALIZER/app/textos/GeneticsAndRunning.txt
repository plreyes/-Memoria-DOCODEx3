To the Editor:

Re "The Secret of Jamaica's Runners" (Sunday Review, Aug. 14):

Orlando Patterson may be a bit too hasty in dismissing a genetic explanation for the success of Jamaicans at track. It may be true that we have few outstanding West African sprinters today, but contemporary West Africans are not the relevant population.

Perhaps that subset of West Africans who wound up in Jamaica years ago was a population greatly enriched for genes that contribute to sprinting skills and an inclination toward running. People harboring such genes would delight in exercising their skills and might well establish a culture in which track was the favorite sport and the one to which many young people aspired.
